# QtTCPJsonChat

This project is a simple chat application using Qt for TCP server-client communication based on JSON messages. The server reads messages from a JSON file and sends them to the client, while the client can respond back to the server. This project demonstrates basic network communication and JSON handling in a Qt-based C++ application.
